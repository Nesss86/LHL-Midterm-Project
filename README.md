# LHL-Midterm-Project


## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to analyze a flight data set that housed information including, but not limited to measures like arrival and dearture times, departure and arrival delays, distance, airline, destination and origin airport, and predict which would be contributing factors to a flight delay. We took advantage of using a classification model with xgboost to try and accurately predict this.
